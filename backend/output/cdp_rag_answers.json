      "answer": "**CDP Question ID: 2.1**  \n**Question: Time horizons definition**  \n\n**Response:**\n\nThe SK Inc. Sustainability Report 2025 does not explicitly define the time horizons used for assessing risks and opportunities related to climate change. However, it does mention the establishment of near-term and long-term reduction targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions as part of its climate risk management system aimed at achieving Net Zero by 2050 (Source: Page 18). \n\nTo provide a comprehensive response regarding time horizons, the following additional data would be beneficial:\n1. Specific definitions or categorizations of short-term, medium-term, and long-term time horizons as applied by SK Inc.\n2. Details on the time frames associated with the near-term and long-term reduction targets mentioned.\n3. Any frameworks or methodologies used to determine these time horizons in relation to climate risks and opportunities.\n\nWithout this information, a precise definition of time horizons as utilized by SK Inc. cannot be fully articulated.",

This process is integrated into the company's overall governance framework and is designed to address the increasing challenges posed by environmental factors, particularly in the context of geopolitical conflicts and trade protectionism, which have heightened uncertainty in the global economy (Source: Page 4).\n\nThe company employs a structured approach to assess and manage environmental risks and opportunities, utilizing key performance indicators (KPIs) that are regularly monitored through the Social Value Management System (SVMS). This system allows for the periodic assessment of ESG performance and the identification of company-specific key issues, which informs the development of phased action plans aimed at achieving top-tier global standards in sustainability (Source: Page 10).\n\nFurthermore, SK Inc. has implemented various environmental management principles and policies, including those focused on pollution prevention, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and renewable energy consumption. These policies are part of a broader commitment to continuous improvement in ESG management and are aligned with global initiatives and reporting standards (Source: Page 179, Page 200).\n\n**Additional Data Needed:**\n- Specific metrics or quantitative data on identified environmental risks and opportunities.\n- Details on the frequency and methodology of risk assessments conducted.\n- Information on stakeholder engagement processes related to environmental risk management.\n- Examples of specific action plans developed in response to identified risks and opportunities.",
