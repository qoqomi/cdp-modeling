      "answer": "**CDP Question ID: 2.1 Response:**\n\n**Short-, Medium-, and Long-Term Time Horizons Definition:**\n\n1. **Short-Term**: Defined as a time horizon ranging from **0 to 2 years**. This period aligns with operational and financial planning cycles, allowing the organization to address immediate climate-related risks and opportunities that may arise due to regulatory changes or shifts in consumer demand.\n\n2. **Medium-Term**: Defined as a time horizon of **2 to 10 years**. This timeframe is used for strategic planning, where the organization evaluates the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on business operations and financial performance. It allows for the assessment of transition risks associated with the shift towards carbon reduction and eco-friendly practices.\n\n3. **Long-Term**: Defined as a time horizon extending from **10 to 30 years**. This period is crucial for assessing the implications of physical climate risks, such as natural disasters and long-term environmental changes, on the organization’s infrastructure and investment strategies. It supports the establishment of sustainability goals, such as the commitment to achieving **No Net Loss** in biodiversity by **2050** and a **No Deforestation Policy** by **2050** (Source: Page 61, 63).\n\n**Linkage to Strategic and Financial Planning:**\n\nThe defined time horizons are directly linked to SK Inc.'s strategic and financial planning processes. The short-term focus allows for agility in responding to immediate risks, while the medium-term perspective supports the integration of sustainability into business strategies. The long-term horizon is essential for planning significant investments in sustainable technologies and infrastructure that will mitigate future climate risks and align with global sustainability goals.\n\n**Rationale for Time Horizon Choices:**\n\nThe choice of these time horizons is based on the nature of environmental risks and opportunities that the organization faces. Short-term risks often stem from regulatory changes and market dynamics, while medium-term risks involve the transition to sustainable practices. Long-term risks are primarily associated with physical climate impacts, which can affect the organization’s operational viability and financial health over time. This structured approach ensures that environmental considerations are integrated into all levels of decision-making, enhancing resilience against climate-related challenges.\n\n**Differences in Timeframes for Other Processes:**\n\nWhile operational and financial planning typically occurs over a **1-2 year** timeframe, the organization recognizes that environmental risks and opportunities may manifest over longer periods. This discrepancy is essential for ensuring that strategic decisions are informed by a comprehensive understanding of potential long-term impacts, thus supporting sustainable growth and compliance with environmental regulations (Source: Page 28).\n\nIn summary, SK Inc. employs a structured approach to define short, medium, and long-term time horizons that align with its strategic and financial planning, ensuring a proactive response to climate-related risks and opportunities.",

      "answer": "**CDP Question ID: 2.2.6 Response:**\n\n**1. Portfolio Overview:**\nSK Inc. employs a comprehensive process for identifying, assessing, and managing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across its investment portfolio. This process is integrated into the company's overall risk management framework, which aligns with ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) and ISO 31000 (Enterprise Risk Management) standards.\n\n**2. Process Description:**\n- **Identification and Assessment:**\n  - The company utilizes a systematic climate risk identification and monitoring system based on scientific data. This includes evaluating the physical and transition risks associated with investee companies.\n  - Transition risks are assessed using a metric known as the 'carbon risk burden ratio,' which compares the actual transition risk against the investee company’s future revenue-generating capacity. If this ratio exceeds the operating profit margin, the company is classified as carbon-constrained and subject to a portfolio adjustment review (Source: Page 40).\n  - Physical risks are analyzed using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios to quantify potential impacts on investment assets over a 15-year horizon. This analysis includes various climate-related hazards such as heatwaves and flooding (Source: Page 39).\n\n- **Management Strategies:**\n  - A phased management strategy is implemented to mitigate identified risks. This includes regular reviews of investee companies' physical risk management systems and the establishment of monitoring systems for high-risk areas (Source: Page 41).\n  - The investment decision-making framework incorporates climate risk assessments, ensuring that the availability of infrastructure to mitigate identified risks is a critical criterion for proceeding with investments in high-risk regions (Source: Page 41).\n\n**3. Frequency and Time Horizons:**\n- The assessment process is conducted at least annually, with internal and external audits verifying the appropriateness and effectiveness of risk assessments (Source: Page 43).\n- The time horizons considered in the assessments include short-term (1-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10-15 years) scenarios, particularly for physical risks (Source: Page 39).\n\n**4. Integration into Risk Management:**\n- The environmental risk management process is integrated into the company-wide enterprise risk management system. Material environmental and climate risks are reported to the CEO and the Board of Directors to ensure a company-wide response (Source: Page 43).\n- The process follows a structured approach of Identification–Analysis–Response–Evaluation–Improvement, ensuring that ESG and business risks are managed holistically (Source: Page 43).\n\n**5. Tools and Methodologies:**\n- SK Inc. utilizes various tools for risk assessment, including the MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk tool for analyzing climate-related financial impacts and external climate data sources for pre-assessing risks (Source: Page 41).\n- The company also engages in scenario analysis to evaluate potential impacts from climate change and regulatory changes, which aids in identifying risks and opportunities (Source: Page 39).\n\n**6. Additional Information Needed:**\n- Specific percentages of portfolio value covered by the assessment process relative to total portfolio value.\n- Details on the qualitative and quantitative nature of the assessments conducted.\n- A breakdown of the types of risks considered (acute physical, chronic physical, policy, technology, market, reputation, liability) in the assessment process.\n- Information on stakeholder engagement processes during the assessment and management phases.\n\nThis response outlines SK Inc.'s robust process for managing environmental risks and opportunities, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and proactive risk management.",

This includes the integration of deforestation risks into the company-wide risk management system, which escalates significant risks to the Strategy and ESG Committee for decision-making. The company aims to maintain forest stability and biodiversity while reducing carbon emissions through afforestation initiatives and conducting deforestation impact assessments when launching new businesses or pursuing acquisitions (Source: Page 63).\n\nThe assessment process incorporates the LEAP Framework developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This framework guides the identification of dependencies and impacts across the value chain, focusing on conserving natural capital and preventing forest degradation. The process includes four phases: Design, Build, Operate, and Decommission, each with specific activities aimed at identifying risks and opportunities related to natural capital (Source: Page 63).\n\n**Integration into the assessment process disclosed in 2.2.2:**  \nThe assessment of interconnections is integrated into the overall climate risk management strategy, which identifies both transition and physical risks across the value chain. This includes managing Scope 3 emissions and improving the environmental performance of products and services (Source: Page 44). The results from the interconnection assessments inform investment decisions and operational strategies, ensuring that environmental considerations are embedded in the company's risk management processes (Source: Page 41).\n\n**Process for identifying alignment, synergies, contributions, and trade-offs:**  \nThe company identifies synergies and trade-offs through scenario analysis and risk assessments that evaluate the potential impacts of environmental dependencies on business operations. For instance, when planning new investments, SK Inc. conducts preliminary analyses to assess climate risk exposure in the relevant regions, which serves as a critical criterion for investment decisions (Source: Page 41). This holistic approach allows for the identification of opportunities in clean technology and sustainable practices while managing associated risks.\n\n**Examples of considering interconnections:**  \nAn example of assessing interconnections includes the evaluation of 5G service provision in ecologically sensitive areas, such as the Namsan area of Seoul, where the company implemented conservation measures to avoid high-impact activities in wildlife protection areas. This assessment considered both the operational needs and the ecological significance of the location (Source: Page 63).\n\n**Challenges faced in integrating aspects into a holistic approach:**  \nWhile SK Inc. has made significant strides in assessing interconnections, challenges remain in fully integrating all aspects due to the complexity of environmental interactions and the need for continuous data collection and analysis. The company recognizes the importance of ongoing improvements in its methodologies and data management systems to enhance its holistic approach to environmental risk management.\n\nIn summary, SK Inc. actively assesses the interconnections between environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities through a structured framework that integrates these considerations into its overall risk management strategy. The company aims to continuously improve its methodologies to address any challenges in achieving a fully integrated approach.",

      "answer": "### CDP Question ID: 2.2.9 Response\n\n**Portfolio Overview:**\nSK Inc. considers environmental information across its investment portfolio, particularly focusing on corporate clients and investee companies. The assessment includes various types of environmental information related to physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change.\n\n**Types of Environmental Information Considered:**\n1. **Physical Risks:**\n   - Utilization of external climate and weather data sources (e.g., MSCI Climate VaR) to pre-assess financial impacts by business site for each investee company.\n   - Regular reviews of each investee company's physical risk management systems to ensure effective response mechanisms are in place.\n   - Separate monitoring systems for business sites located in high-risk areas, with continuous reviews to confirm the functioning of climate risk response systems.\n\n2. **Transition Risks:**\n   - Evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of emissions reduction measures implemented by investee companies.\n   - Assessment of the marketability of investee companies to withstand transition risks, using a metric called the 'carbon risk burden ratio' which compares the actual transition risk against the investee company’s future revenue-generating capacity.\n   - Classification of companies as carbon-constrained if their carbon risk burden ratio exceeds their operating profit margin, leading to a portfolio adjustment review.\n\n**Process Through Which Information is Obtained:**\n- The environmental information is primarily gathered through direct assessments of investee companies' management systems and external data sources. This includes preliminary analyses conducted before new investments or business expansions to determine climate risk exposure in relevant regions.\n\n**Percentage of Portfolio Covered:**\n- The specific percentage of the portfolio covered by this environmental assessment process is not provided in the sustainability report. Additional data regarding the total portfolio value and the proportion of investments subjected to these assessments would be necessary to complete this section.\n\n**Total Portfolio Value Covered by the Process:**\n- As the percentage of the portfolio covered is not specified, the total portfolio value covered by the process cannot be calculated without further information on the total assets value reported in question 1.10.\n\n### Summary\nSK Inc. integrates comprehensive environmental assessments into its investment decision-making framework, focusing on both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. However, specific quantitative data regarding the percentage of the portfolio covered and the total portfolio value is missing and would be required for a complete response. \n\n**References:**\n- SK Inc.

The assessments are aligned with international standards and are reviewed at the board and executive levels (Source: Page 61).\n\n2. **Definition of Scope and Extent of Biodiversity Assessment:**\n   The scope of the biodiversity assessments is defined by:\n   - The ecological characteristics of the areas surrounding business sites.\n   - The level of biodiversity risk associated with these areas.\n   - The potential impacts of business operations on local biodiversity.\n   The assessments specifically consider the habitats of endangered species within a 50 km radius of key operational sites, such as the Jongno and Pangyo Offices, identifying 102 and 98 potentially present endangered species, respectively (Source: Page 61-62).\n\n3. **Aspects Considered in the Assessment:**\n   The assessment covers various aspects, including:\n   - Physical risks to biodiversity.\n   - Provisioning services (e.g., resources provided by ecosystems).\n   - Regulating and supporting services (e.g., ecosystem functions).\n   - Reputational risks associated with biodiversity impacts.\n   The assessments also consider socioeconomic factors and other reputational factors (Source: Page 62).\n\n4. **Baseline Biodiversity Data Availability:**\n   Yes, baseline biodiversity data was collected as part of the assessment. This data is integrated into the company's risk management system and is readily accessible for decision-making processes (Source: Page 61).\n\n5. **Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Availability:**\n   Yes, the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is publicly available. It can be accessed through the company’s website, ensuring that all stakeholders and interested parties can review the information (Source: Page 61).\n\n6. **Additional Information:**\n   The biodiversity risk assessments are part of a broader biodiversity protection policy that aims for \"No Net Loss\" and \"Net Positive Impact\" on biodiversity by 2050. The policy is regularly reviewed, and significant biodiversity-related risks are escalated to the Strategy and ESG Committee for major decision-making (Source: Page 61-63).\n\nIn summary, SK Inc. has a structured process for identifying and assessing biodiversity impacts, integrating these assessments into its overall risk management framework, and ensuring public access to relevant environmental information. Further details on specific methodologies or quantitative metrics used in the assessments could enhance this response.",

This assessment is integrated into the company's risk management processes, particularly through the adoption of the LEAP Framework developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This framework allows for the identification of dependencies and impacts across various operational phases—design, build, operate, and decommission—while focusing on natural capital conservation and deforestation prevention (Source: Page 63).\n\n**Process for identifying alignment, synergies, contributions, and trade-offs:**  \nThe company identifies dependencies and impacts using sector-specific tools, such as the ENCORE tool, which categorizes these as high, medium, or low significance. This analysis includes evaluating ecosystem services and assets related to organizational processes, assessing the level of ecosystem conservation, and identifying areas of water stress. The results inform decision-making regarding investments and operational strategies, ensuring that environmental considerations are integrated into business planning (Source: Page 63).\n\n**Examples of interconnections considered:**  \n1. **Climate Risk Management:** SK Inc. has established a multi-layered response strategy to protect its investment portfolio from physical risks associated with climate change. This includes utilizing reliable external climate data to assess financial impacts and ensuring that investee companies have robust climate risk management systems in place (Source: Page 41).\n2. **Deforestation Policy:** The company integrates deforestation risks into its risk management system, with significant risks escalated to the Strategy and ESG Committee for decision-making. This approach ensures that environmental impacts are considered alongside business opportunities (Source: Page 63).\n\n**Challenges faced in integrating these aspects:**  \nWhile SK Inc. has made significant strides in assessing interconnections, challenges remain in fully integrating all aspects into a holistic approach. These challenges may include data availability, the complexity of environmental interactions, and the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation of strategies to align with evolving environmental standards and regulations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSK Inc. recognizes the importance of assessing the interconnections between environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities as part of its overall sustainability strategy. The company aims to enhance its methodologies and frameworks continually to improve integration and effectiveness in addressing these critical areas.\n\n**Additional Data Needed:**  \nTo provide a more detailed response, specific metrics or quantitative data on the outcomes of the assessments, such as the number of significant risks identified and mitigated, or examples of successful integration of environmental considerations into business decisions, would be beneficial. Additionally, insights into future plans for enhancing the assessment process would strengthen the response.",

      "answer": "**CDP Question ID: 2.3 Response:**\n\n**Priority Locations Identification:**\n\nYes, SK Inc. has identified priority locations across its value chain where its activities interface with nature. These locations have been prioritized for action due to their ecological sensitivity and the company's substantive dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities related to biodiversity.\n\n**Description of Process to Identify Priority Locations:**\n\n1. **Tools and Data Sources:**\n   - SK Inc. employs tools such as the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) and the Biodiversity Risk Filter (BRF) developed by IUCN and WWF to assess biodiversity risks and natural capital surrounding business sites (Source: Page 61).\n   - A location-based approach is utilized to account for the ecological characteristics and biodiversity risk levels of areas surrounding business sites (Source: Page 61).\n\n2. **Indicators and Metrics:**\n   - The company assesses biodiversity risks and potential impacts in areas surrounding its business sites and local communities, integrating these assessments into its company-wide risk management system (Source: Page 61).\n   - Specific metrics include the identification of endangered species within a 50 km radius of directly operated sites, which has revealed 102 potentially present endangered species around the Jongno Office and 98 species around the Pangyo Office (Source: Page 61).\n\n3. **Determining Substantive Dependencies, Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities:**\n   - A focused biodiversity risk assessment is conducted, particularly for high-energy-consuming sites like the Pangyo and Daedeok Data Centers, which are evaluated for both direct and indirect environmental impacts (Source: Page 62).\n   - The assessment considers biodiversity dependency risks and impact-related risks stemming from business activities, ensuring that operations are managed to minimize environmental impact (Source: Page 61).\n\n4. **Geographic Specificity:**\n   - The assessments are conducted at a detailed geographic level, focusing on specific business sites and their surrounding areas. For instance, the Pangyo and Daedeok Data Centers have been assessed for their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, with evaluations of adjacent areas included in the risk assessments (Source: Page 62).\n\n5. **Future Improvements:**\n   - SK Inc. plans to enhance its process for identifying priority locations by continuing to refine its risk assessment methodologies and expanding monitoring efforts to include more comprehensive ecological evaluations across its operations.\n\n**List and/or Spatial Map of Priority Locations:**\n\nCurrently, a detailed list or spatial map of identified priority locations is not provided in the sustainability report. To fully comply with the CDP requirements, SK Inc. would need to disclose a list or spatial map of these locations, specifying which of them are in or near sensitive locations and detailing the nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities identified at each site.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSK Inc. has established a robust framework for identifying priority locations within its value chain, focusing on biodiversity risks and conservation efforts. However, the absence of a disclosed list or spatial map of these locations limits the completeness of the response. Further data on specific priority locations and their characteristics would enhance transparency and alignment with CDP expectations.",

      "answer": "**CDP Question ID: 2.4 Response: Definition of Substantive Effects on SK Inc.**\n\n**Definition of Substantive Effects:**\nAt SK Inc., a substantive effect is defined as an impact that has a considerable or significant influence on the organization at the corporate level, particularly in terms of environmental risks and opportunities. This definition encompasses operational, financial, and strategic effects that could undermine or create opportunities for the entire organization or specific business units. \n\n**Indicators and Thresholds:**\nThe organization employs several indicators to determine what constitutes a substantive effect, including:\n\n1. **Proportion of Business Units Affected:** The extent to which various business units are impacted by environmental risks or opportunities.\n2. **Magnitude of the Effect:** The size of the impact on affected business units, which can be quantified in terms of revenue, operational capacity, or market share.\n3. **Dependency on Affected Units:** The degree to which the organization relies on the business units experiencing the effect.\n4. **Stakeholder Concerns:** The potential for shareholder or customer concern regarding the identified risks or opportunities.\n\nFor example, a risk that could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over the short term would be considered substantive, as it would significantly affect the organization’s financial health (Page 17).\n\n**Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics:**\nThe organization uses both quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess substantive effects. Quantitatively, a threshold of a 10% change in revenue or a significant increase in operational costs is considered substantive. Qualitatively, the organization evaluates the frequency and likelihood of occurrence of these effects, assessing them as high, medium, or low impact based on their potential consequences (Page 144).\n\n**Application of Definition:**\nThe thresholds for what is deemed substantive are regularly reviewed and updated based on ongoing assessments of environmental risks and opportunities. This includes a matrix approach where multiple metrics are considered in combination, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of potential impacts. The organization conducts annual reviews of these metrics to ensure relevance and accuracy in response to changing environmental and market conditions (Page 170).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, SK Inc. defines substantive effects through a combination of quantitative thresholds and qualitative assessments, focusing on the potential impact on business units, financial performance, and stakeholder perceptions. This approach ensures that the organization remains proactive in identifying and managing environmental risks and opportunities that could significantly affect its operations and strategic direction.\n\n**Additional Data Needed:**\nWhile the current response outlines the definition and application of substantive effects, further details on specific thresholds used for different business units, as well as historical examples of identified substantive effects, would enhance the comprehensiveness of this response. Additionally, data on the frequency of occurrence and the likelihood of these effects would provide a clearer picture of the organization's risk management framework.",
