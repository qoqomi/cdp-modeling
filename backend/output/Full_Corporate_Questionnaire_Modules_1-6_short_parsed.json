      "additional_information": "TCFD and TNFD position on time horizons:  \n• Because the timing of effects on organizations will vary, specifying set timeframes across \nsectors could hinder organizations’ consideration of the environmental risks and opportunities \nspecific to their businesses.  \n• TCFD and TNFD do not define timeframes and encourage respondents to decide how to define \ntheir own timeframes considering the useful life of their assets or infrastructure, the profile of \nthe environmental risks they face, the sectors and geographies in which they operate, and that \nenvironmental risks and opportunities can manifest themselves over the medium and long \nterm. \n\n69 \n• In assessing environmental issues, organizations should be sensitive to the timeframe used to \nconduct their assessments. While many organizations conduct operational and financial \nplanning over a 1–2-year timeframe, and strategic and capital planning over a 2-5-year \ntimeframe, environmental risks and opportunities may have implications over a longer period. It \nis therefore important for organizations to consider the appropriate timeframes when \nassessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.",

The TNFD \ndisclosure guidance recommends that an organization discloses the full list of priority locations (i.e., \na list of all locations that meet at least one of the “Priority locations” criteria) under recommended \ndisclosure Strategy D. This applies even if organizations choose to apply further prioritization criteria. \nAccording to the TNFD, the concept of “priority locations” is based on the premise that organizations \nare more likely to face nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in locations \nwith certain characteristics. An organization should bear in mind that this prioritization is part of an \niterative process, with location prioritization guiding the assessment of dependencies, impacts, risks, \nand opportunities and vice versa. \n\nWWF tools to assess for ‘priority locations’ \nThe WWF Water Risk Filter and the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter are accepted tools to assess \nsensitive locations as defined by the TNFD. \n\nWWF Water Risk Filter \n• \nAreas important for biodiversity: when the reputational risk category “Environmental \nFactors” and associated indicators are greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4..
