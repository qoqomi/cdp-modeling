Corporate efforts to address climate change play a critical role in supporting national greenhouse gas reduction goals and \nminimizing environmental and social impacts—both of which are essential for corporate sustainable development.\nSK Inc. has identified climate change response as a key priority within its company-wide sustainability management. The company is committed \nto enhancing environmental value by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through initiatives such as expanding renewable energy use, optimizing \nproduction processes, transitioning to electric vehicles, and decarbonizing the supply chain. These efforts contribute to increasing environmental \nvalue by generating positive outcomes such as mitigating climate risks.\nHowever, in certain business areas, there is still a dependency on fossil fuel–based energy and electricity, posing potential risks that could \nworsen the climate crisis. These risks may lead to increased carbon-related costs, stricter regulations, and heightened ESG expectations from \nstakeholders, all of which could negatively affect corporate sustainability.\n·  Scope of impacted value chain: Business sites, products/services, supply chain\n·  Key stakeholders impacted: Environment, customers (end users), suppliers\nResponse \nstrategies\n1) Climate risk management system\n·  Recognition of climate change as a significant risk to financial soundness and operational continuity\n· Advancement of risk management through the establishment of a scientific, data-based identification and monitoring system\n· Integration of policy changes, industry trends, and stakeholder expectations into company-wide risk strategy\n2) Expansion of renewable energy use\n·  Implementation of RE100 (self-generation, PPAs, etc.)\n·  Achievement of a 24.7% RE100 implementation rate in 2024, exceeding the target by 1.7%\nMid- to Long-\nTerm Plans\n·  Establishment of Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets (near-term and long-term) for achieving Net Zero\n·  Establishment of Scope 3 reduction targets to achieve SK Group’s 2050-α Net Zero goal\n▶ See detailed report\nActual/Potential \nImpacts\nEthical management and anti-corruption may result in widespread societal harm and increased social costs. Responsible practices such as \nanti-corruption, fair trade, and human rights protection serve as key standards for building trust with various stakeholders including investors, \ncustomers, and governments. As such, they represent material issues with significant implications for society at large.\nSK Inc. upholds ethical management and transparency as top priorities across all aspects of its business operations. These principles are \nfundamental to earning trust in global markets and establishing long-term relationships with stakeholders. A strong commitment to ethical \nconduct not only reduces social costs but also enhances corporate reputation and brand equity. This helps build trust with investors, customers, \nand business partners, and strengthens the foundation for sustainable business practices.\nConversely, unethical behavior or corruption involving employees or executives can severely damage brand image and erode stakeholder \nconfidence. It may also disrupt corporate culture, leading to lower employee morale, decreased productivity, and increased turnover. In light of \ntightening ESG-related regulations and heightened disclosure expectations, a lack of transparency may result in tangible social costs, such as \nfines, lawsuits, and divestments.\n·  Scope of impacted value chain: Business sites, supply chain\nKey stakeholders impacted: Society, customers (end users), suppliers\nResponse \nstrategies\n1) Operation of Committees and Implementation of Audits\n·  Operation of an internal control and ethics/compliance risk management system centered on the Audit Committee\n·  Execution of 14 Audit Committee meetings in 2024 and implementation of annual audits focused on domestic and overseas subsidiaries and \nstaff functions\n·  Enhancement of risk response effectiveness through the early identification and prevention of operational risks, including those related to the \nsupply chain, quality, and finance\n2) Ethical Management Training\n·  Provision of annual ethical management training for all members of the organization (including permanent, contract, and part-time employees) \nto enhance awareness and prevent corruption\n·  Mandatory annual completion of at least one training program related to assigned audit areas by all members of the dedicated team\n·  Provision of online ethical management training for supplier personnel assigned to company projects, including an overview of the company’s \nethical management system, key violation cases, and available reporting channels\nMid- to Long-\nTerm Plans\n·  Achievement of ‘Leader’ level in the ethical management evaluation system\n·  Establishment and expansion of the anti-corruption management system\n·  Elimination of unfair trade and unfair competitive practices\n▶ See detailed report\n01\n02\nStakeholder Engagement      Double Materiality Assessment      Impact Material Topics      Financial Material Topics",

Sustainability Report 2025\n019\nTalent Development and Human Capital Management\nRespect for and Protection of Human Rights\nActual/Potential \nImpacts\nSK Inc. plays a key role in enhancing the quality of life for employees and local communities by providing quality employment, maintaining a \nfair compensation system, and promoting mutual growth with supplier companies. These efforts represent a core strategy for fulfilling social \nresponsibility while laying the foundation for sustainable growth.\nEffective talent management allows the company to strengthen its competitiveness, improve productivity and operational efficiency, and foster \na positive corporate culture. In the process of strengthening talent development and human resource practices, SK Inc. also contributes to local \neconomic revitalization by offering educational and vocational training opportunities to communities. Such initiatives help generate employment \nopportunities and support the inclusion of vulnerable groups and youth in the labor market, thereby reinforcing the company’s commitment to \nsocial responsibility.\nHowever, disparities in job quality and access to employment—as well as growth concentrated in specific sectors or regions—pose potential \nrisks, such as widening gaps in talent development and increasing social inequality. In particular, during periods of digital transformation and \nindustrial restructuring, low-skilled workers and younger generations may face exclusion from the workforce, leading to potential declines in their \nquality of life.\n·  Scope of impacted value chain: Business sites\n·  Key stakeholders impacted: Society, employees, suppliers\nResponse \nstrategies\n1) Implementation of Fair Recruitment and Evaluation Systems\n·  Introduction of AI-based recruitment agents in 2024, the first among major domestic corporations, to ensure fair and consistent evaluation \nthroughout the recruitment process\n·  Execution of objective evaluations based on competency-driven criteria (e.g., career vision, expertise, potential) to prevent gender \ndiscrimination risks in recruitment and promotion processes\n·  Selection of leadership candidates based on competency, qualifications, and performance regardless of gender, and provision of \nindividualized career development planning and support\n2) Operation of AX College\n·  Recognition of talent development as a core driver of corporate competitiveness and implementation of various training and support programs\n·  Systematic support for capability development of employees and supplier companies through AX College, with customized training programs \nto enhance job expertise\n·  Promotion of balanced growth across job functions and expansion of educational opportunities for diverse groups in collaboration with local \ncommunities through comprehensive talent development policies\nMid- to Long-\nTerm Plans\n·  Expansion of the proportion of female employees and managers\n·  Securing of talent for future growth, along with structural improvement and process innovation\n·  Establishment of a corporate culture that supports work–life balance for employees\n▶ See detailed report\nActual/Potential \nImpacts\nEnsuring the protection of workers’ rights and proactively identifying and addressing potential human rights risks across the supply chain are \nfundamental to establishing a foundation for corporate sustainability. A structured approach to human rights risk management enables the \nprotection of not only employees but also a wide range of stakeholders, including supplier companies, making it a critical component of corporate \ngovernance and social responsibility. \nRegular human rights impact assessments, improvements in working conditions, and the implementation of systems to prevent discrimination \nand harassment help mitigate the risk of legal disputes, consumer boycotts, and reputational damage—thereby reducing potential social costs \nbefore they arise. Proactive prevention of human rights risks enhances long-term corporate credibility and fosters positive ripple effects, such as \nreduced social conflict and operational cost savings.\nOn the other hand, failures to address human rights issues can significantly damage a company’s reputation and erode public trust, potentially \nresulting in legal action or regulatory sanctions. If such violations lead to investor withdrawal or divestment, the resulting social losses can escalate \nrapidly. Moreover, a breakdown in trust with local communities may intensify conflicts between the company and the region, increasing the cost \nof recovery and negatively impacting social stability.\n·  Scope of impacted value chain: Business sites, supply chain\n· Key stakeholders impacted: Society, employees, suppliers\nResponse \nstrategies\n1) Implementation of Regular Human Rights Impact Assessments\n·  Identification and improvement of potential risks through regular human rights impact assessments across all business sites and supplier \ncompanies\n·  Assurance of objectivity and credibility in assessments through collaboration with external expert organizations\n·  Planned expansion of the assessment scope to include mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and joint ventures\n2) Operation of a Human Rights Risk Assessment System\n· Operation of a human rights risk assessment and management system led by the legal department\n·  Establishment of a framework aligned with global standards and reinforcement of stakeholder human rights protection\n·  Maintenance of a consistent level of human rights management with an achievement rate exceeding 90% since 2022\nMid- to Long-\nTerm Plans\n·  Advancement and integration of human rights management\n·  Expansion of supplier capacity-building programs for autonomous human rights management and risk management\n·  Expansion of human rights management achievements\n▶ See detailed report\n03\n04\nStakeholder Engagement      Double Materiality Assessment      Impact Material Topics      Financial Material Topics",

Strengthening safety and health policies, monitoring their \nimplementation, and consistently providing training and awareness activities can significantly reduce the risk of industrial accidents and related \nsocial costs.

Such measures help reduce not only direct costs—such as medical expenses and compensation—but also long-\nterm losses related to decreased productivity and costs arising from social losses.\nIn contrast, insufficient safety and health measures can negatively affect not only employees but also the health of neighboring communities. \nIn the event of an accident or major industrial incident, the consequences may extend beyond corporate risk, resulting in public criticism and \nsignificant economic losses.\n·  Scope of impacted value chain: Business sites, supply chain\n·  Key stakeholders impacted: Society, employees, suppliers\nResponse \nstrategies\n1) Operation of Risk Assessment\n·  Implementation of annual risk assessments at all business sites to identify hazardous and risk factors in advance\n·  Development of improvement plans based on quantified risk levels and acceptability-based risk grading\n·  Integration of risk assessment results into company-wide safety management strategies to enhance the overall management system\n2) Enhancement of Supplier Capabilities\n· Improvement of supplier response capabilities through safety training and risk management support programs\n·  Introduction and implementation of an accident prevention-centered management system\nMid- to Long-\nTerm Plans\n·  Establishment of an optimized SHE system aligned with business operations and early stabilization of SHE Basic \n· Enhancement of SHE competitiveness through a virtuous cycle of training, assessment, and improvement\n· Internalization of a business organization-centered autonomous safety culture at worksites \n▶ See detailed report\n05\nStakeholder Engagement      Double Materiality Assessment      Impact Material Topics      Financial Material Topics",

Impact Analysis and Response Measures\n1) Net Zero Implementation\n·  South Korea’s renewable energy supply policies and pricing mechanisms present structural risks for companies pursuing RE100, particularly in terms of limited \nprocurement options and price volatility\n·  In practice, the availability and efficiency of renewable energy procurement methods—such as self-generation, green premiums, and PPAs—are heavily influenced by \ngovernment policies, leading to significant variability and potential uncertainty in establishing long-term strategies for achieving RE100\n·  In line with the self-generation-first strategy, solar power facilities with a total capacity of 650kW are in operation by maximizing the use of available space within business \nsites. This is expected to reduce annual electricity costs by approximately KRW 100 million and cut more than 400 tons of greenhouse gas emissions\n·  In addition to self-generation, a strategic combination of multiple renewable energy procurement methods—such as green premiums, power purchase agreements (PPAs), \nand renewable energy certificates (RECs)—is under active review\n·  Since 2021, SK Inc. has participated in RE100 policy discussions hosted by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

operating costs, and rising ambient temperatures are \na key physical risk factor that directly leads to increased electricity expenses\n·  The growing frequency of heatwaves and tropical nights during summer elevates cooling system usage, resulting in higher energy consumption and potentially driving up \ncumulative annual operating costs\n·  A sustained 1°C increase in average external temperature could raise annual electricity costs by approximately 2.5–3.5%, resulting in an estimated additional expenditure \nof KRW 440 to 620 million per year\n·  Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (a global warming pathway exceeding 4°C), the likelihood of damage to data center assets from large-scale river flooding—currently \nconsidered 100-year occurrences—is projected to increase significantly after 2030\n·  In the event of flooding, facility restoration costs and business interruption losses could amount to more than 30% of the total asset value of the data center\n·  Power outages and service disruptions may result in compensation claims due to customer SLA violations, along with additional recovery costs\n·  To mitigate physical risks associated with rising temperatures, high-efficiency HVAC systems are being introduced and energy-saving operational strategies are being \nimplemented in phases\n-  To enhance cooling efficiency, an automatic misting system has been installed around the chiller units to supplement the performance of outdoor air cooling\n- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions are utilized to precisely analyze airflow and optimize the performance of the HVAC system\n-  Data center-specific energy efficiency strategies are being continuously reinforced, including the replacement of inefficient HVAC equipment, relocation of IT devices, \nand advanced temperature control by zone\n·  Disaster response infrastructure is being established to withstand heavy rainfall exceeding 100mm per hour, with flood response drills and humidity control simulation \ntraining conducted at least once a year on a regular basis\n-  During weather advisories, preemptive inspections and reinforcements of key infrastructure—such as leakage points, drainage pumps, and channels—are conducted \nto prevent potential damage\n-  To prepare for large-scale power outages, a dual power system with high-capacity UPS units and emergency generators is maintained, along with regular power \nswitchover drills to ensure immediate and uninterrupted transition to backup power during grid failure\n-  These measures are intended to ensure the

strategies through its ‘2050 Carbon Neutrality Scenario,’ including energy management systems (EMS), building \nenergy efficiency improvements, and expansion of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure—serving as a foundation for increased demand for related IT solutions\n·  Demand is expected to rise, particularly in the manufacturing sector and energy-intensive industries, for advanced EMS, EV charging station management platforms, and \nIT services linked to emissions monitoring\n·  According to the latest IEA Net Zero scenario, achieving the 1.5°C target is unlikely under the current Net Zero 2050 strategies alone, indicating the need for stronger \nregulations and carbon reduction efforts driven by digital technologies\n·  As Scope 3 reduction requirements (including supply chain emissions) continue to expand, managing carbon footprints based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and \nparticipating in carbon credit markets are emerging as key non-financial strategic priorities among global companies\n·  Approximately 60% of the hardware (H/W) and network (N/W) equipment required for IT service delivery is sourced from overseas manufacturing facilities located in \ncountries such as China, Malaysia, Ireland, and Singapore (as of 2022)\n·  According to scenario analyses under SSP5 to SSP8.5, these regions are identified as having relatively high risks of water stress and other climate-related disasters, \nincluding floods and heatwaves, indicating vulnerabilities in the supply chain\n·  In the event of natural disasters that disrupt raw material procurement or suspend the production of specific equipment, indirect impacts may include delivery delays, \nincreased procurement costs, higher prices of competing products, disruptions to customer project timelines, and revenue losses\n·  As the importance of value chain management grows and transparency in emissions reductions becomes increasingly demanded, the need for digital management \nsystems to support GHG measurement and verification, emissions tracking, and carbon credit transactions is expected to rise\n·  Leveraging its digital capabilities in big data, AI, and blockchain, SK Inc. views this rising climate response demand as a business opportunity driven by digital transformation\n·  In particular, SK Inc. is developing and providing end-to-end climate response services—from carbon emissions monitoring and reduction simulation to carbon credit-\nlinked transactions—from the perspective of serving as a ‘Green Digital Partner’ to support customers in their Net Zero transition\n·  To address physical risks at the supply chain level, business continuity planning (BCP) status is reviewed for key suppliers, and suppliers are requested to establish climate \nrisk response plans\n·  To prevent overconcentration of manufacturing bases in high-risk areas, the results of regular risk monitoring are incorporated into supply diversification strategies\n·  Physical climate risk levels

clear standards for \nintellectual property ownership of AI-\ngenerated content have yet to be established. \nAs a result, companies utilizing such \ntechnologies must consider both legal and \nethical risks, leading to the recognition of this \nissue as a new form of emerging risk\nRisk Impact\n·  SK Inc. actively operates in global markets \nthrough a network of approximately 570 \nsubsidiaries and branches worldwide, including \nproduction and sales activities in high-risk \nregions such as China and the Middle East\n·  These dynamics have an impact on the \nperformance of major SK Group subsidiaries and \nmay have long-term implications for SK Inc.’s \nearnings (including equity-method gains and \ndividends)\n·  Mid- to long-term financial and strategic impacts:\n-  Increased procurement costs due to \ndisruptions in raw material and energy supply\n-  Decline in profitability\n-  Weakened market access for core businesses \nsuch as semiconductors and batteries due \nto tighter export restrictions on advanced \ntechnology products, and the need for mid- \nto long-term strategic adjustments driven by \nrising costs for supply chain diversification \nand restructuring\n-  Potential invisible damage to brand value \nand corporate credibility from business \nwithdrawal or downsizing in local markets\n·  As the holding company of the SK Group \nthat owns the SK brand, SK Inc. operates \nwithin a structure where reputational \ndamage to its subsidiaries or affiliates \ncan have a ripple effect across the entire \ngroup\n·  The spread of misinformation and \ndisinformation about a specific affiliate is \nexpected to lead to a decline in SK Inc.’s \nbrand value and a loss of trust among \nconsumers and investors\n·  Mid- to long-term financial and strategic \nimpacts:\n-  Potential occurrence of stock price \ndecline, litigation, and regulatory risks \nresulting from a general decline in trust \nin the SK Group brand\n-  Potential mid- to long-term financial \nrisks, including a decrease in brand \nroyalty income and dividend revenue \nfrom subsidiaries for SK Inc.\n-  Increasing need to restructure \ncorporate strategy and crisis \ncommunication systems\n·  As the holding company of a technology-driven \ngroup operating businesses in semiconductors, \nAI, and data centers, SK Inc. handles a wide \nrange of both external and proprietary internal \ndata in the course of its operations\n·  With the growing use of generative AI, SK Inc. \nfaces a potential risk of infringing on others’ \nintellectual property rights when utilizing \nexternal data for AI training and related purposes\n·  There is a risk that SK Inc.’s data or outputs \nmay be used without authorization by external \nparties, potentially resulting in the infringement \nof its intellectual property rights\n·  Mid- to long-term financial and strategic \nimpacts:\n-  Litigation costs and compensation payments \nin the event of intellectual property disputes\n-  Decline in corporate credibility and brand \nvalue\n-  Growing need to restructure internal control \nsystems related to information security and IP\n-  Overall decrease in profitability due to \nweakened technological competitiveness of \nsubsidiaries\nRisk Response \nActivities\n·  Strengthened monitoring of geopolitical risks \nand scenario-based analysis\n-  Country-level forecasting of political and \ndiplomatic risks and analysis of impacts on \nkey industries\n·  Implementation of supply chain diversification \nand risk avoidance strategies in high-risk regions\n-  Regional selection and structural assessment \nfor new overseas projects with consideration \nof geopolitical risks\n·  Establishment of a management framework and \ninclusion of geopolitical risk as a defined item \nwithin SK Group’s integrated risk management \nsystem\n·  Management of geopolitical risks as part of the \ncompany-wide risk management framework\n·  Establishment of a real-time detection and \nresponse system for misinformation and \ndisinformation\n-  Operation of a continuous monitoring \nsystem for external channels, including \nmedia and social media\n·  Implementation of a fact-based, proactive, \nand transparent communication strategy\n-  Regular IR and NDR sessions targeting \ninvestors\n-  Prompt response through official \nconsumer-facing channels such as the \ncompany website, social media, and \nYouTube\n·  Management of monitoring frequency \nbased on the company-wide risk register \nin accordance with the company-wide risk \nmanagement system\n ·  Analysis of global trends and regulations related \nto intellectual property rights concerning AI and \ndata utilization\n-  Operation of training programs focused on \nrelevant laws and case studies for working-\nlevel and technical staff\n·  Periodic review of internal data usage and \nassessment of potential intellectual property \ninfringement\n-  Refinement of the process for managing \ndata sources used in AI model training and \nreviewing the scope of their use\n·  Specification of AI usage standards within \ninternal codes of ethics and information security \nprinciple\n-  Introduction of internal policies on AI and \ndata utilization and application of a company-\nwide monitoring system\n·  Classification and continuous monitoring of \nemerging risks through the identification process \nwithin the company-wide risk management \nsystem\nGovernance      Ethics and Compliance      Risk Management",
