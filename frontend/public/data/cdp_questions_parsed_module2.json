For example, pollution stemming from pesticide use or climate change. o Policy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing) policies to create positive impacts on nature or mitigate negative impacts on nature; o Technology – Substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on nature and/or reduced dependency on nature. For example, the replacement of plastics with biodegradable containers; o Market – Changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer preferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and reputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value of a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is insufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’ production process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require less water to operate; o Reputation – Changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or perceived nature impacts, including at the local, economic and societal level. This can result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or impacts of activities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain. o Liability – Liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims.

This will be used to understand the threshold for your reported risks and opportunities in 3.1 and 3.6.",
        "What constitutes a substantive effect will vary between organizations. You are therefore asked to determine ‘substantive’ in the way that you would do for your business decision-making. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different effects on different organizations depending on its respective profit margins. A substantive effect of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large impact on one of the following aspects, or because of a small number for all three combines to create a larger effect: o the proportion of business units affected; o the size of the effect on those business units; o the dependency of the organization on that unit; and/or o the potential for shareholder or customer concern.",
