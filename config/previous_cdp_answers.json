This process incorporates the principle of double materiality, integrating both financial materiality and environmental and social impacts. Within the company's enterprise risk management (ERM) system, climate-related risks are categorized into transition and physical risks and are regularly reviewed. Scenario-based qualitative and quantitative assessments are conducted across short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons to evaluate potential impacts. The results of these assessments are reflected in business strategies and financial planning and are reported to senior management through ESG committees and executive meetings. When necessary, relevant information is also reported to the Board of Directors. The prioritization of risks is based on a combination of quantitative factors, such as likelihood and financial impact, and qualitative factors, including reputational or regulatory considerations, to determine the appropriate response strategies."

          "value": "SK Inc. recognizes that while our business does not rely on direct extraction or use of natural resources, our digital infrastructure—especially data centers—has significant dependencies on electricity and water, both of which are interconnected through climate-related dynamics. To evaluate these interconnections, we used the ENCORE tool (provided by UNEP) based on our sector classification ISIC 620: Computer programming, consultancy and related activities. The analysis identified 9 material dependencies on ecosystem services, including local climate regulation and water provisioning, and 2 medium materiality environmental pressures (land use and disturbances such as noise or light). In particular, data centers require both electricity and water for cooling. Under drought or degraded water quality scenarios, this interconnection results in lower cooling efficiency, increased electricity demand, operational costs, and Scope 2 emissions—demonstrating the cascading nature of environmental risks. As ENCORE provides global-level data by industry, we complemented this analysis with location-specific evaluations, including water stress indices and climate scenario analysis for the regions where our data centers operate. These assessments are structured using the DIRO framework (Dependencies–Impacts–Risks–Opportunities) and are integrated into our enterprise risk management (ERM) system. The insights inform decisions such as site selection, green cooling technologies, and AI-driven energy efficiency measures."

Unlike resource-intensive or manufacturing sectors, our value chain does not currently exhibit highly localized environmental risk concentrations. To date, we have assessed that climate- and nature-related risks are not likely to have immediate or material strategic impacts at specific geographic locations, and therefore the identification of priority locations has not been established as an immediate strategic priority. However, we are conducting selective location-based risk assessments for key assets such as data centers."

Transition risks were examined from various perspectives, including policy/law, technology, market, and reputation, to develop a risk pool. Physical risks were classified as acute or chronic to form another risk pool. For each risk in the pool, the business impact and short-term/medium-term/long-term time frames were considered, and priorities were rated as high, medium, or low to identify significant risks. In addition, if climate change-related risks exceed 1% of equity, they are considered significant and must be reported to and addressed by a decision-making body involving the CEO or higher executives. Furthermore, if there are concerns or demands for improvement from stakeholders such as customers, investors, governments, and NGOs regarding climate change-related risks, or if negative social value factors such as a decline in external reputation are predicted, both the financial impact from an economic value perspective and the strategic impact from a social value perspective are considered."

The company evaluates key opportunities across three dimensions—energy resources, market dynamics, and product/service innovation—and assesses their potential business and financial impact across short- (0–3 years), medium- (4–10 years), and long-term (over 10 years) horizons. For example, the accelerating transition from fossil fuel-based systems to renewable energy sources presents new business opportunities in areas such as battery materials, green energy solutions, and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. In addition, increasing demand for sustainable food sources, energy-efficient products, and IT-based environmental management services is expected to have a positive effect on SK Inc.'s operations. In the short term, these opportunities are linked to the development of eco-friendly technologies and investments in high-efficiency systems. Over the medium and long term, they support the expansion of the company's sustainable investment portfolio and serve as a foundation for generating revenue. Specifically, SK Inc. is pursuing strategic investments in EV materials and infrastructure, energy transition, and industrial transformation. These opportunities are not only part of the company's environmental response, but also represent a core strategic pathway to enhance long-term competitiveness and profitability."
