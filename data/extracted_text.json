These efforts contribute to increasing environmental\nActual/Potential\nvalue by generating positive outcomes such as mitigating climate risks.\nImpacts\nHowever, in certain business areas, there is still a dependency on fossil fuel–based energy and electricity, posing potential risks that could\nworsen the climate crisis.

This helps build trust with investors, customers,\nActual/Potential and business partners, and strengthens the foundation for sustainable business practices.\nImpacts\nConversely, unethical behavior or corruption involving employees or executives can severely damage brand image and erode stakeholder\nconfidence. It may also disrupt corporate culture, leading to lower employee morale, decreased productivity, and increased turnover.

In the process of strengthening talent development and human resource practices, SK Inc. also contributes to local\neconomic revitalization by offering educational and vocational training opportunities to communities.

A structured approach to human rights risk management enables the\nprotection of not only employees but also a wide range of stakeholders, including supplier companies, making it a critical component of corporate\ngovernance and social responsibility.\nRegular human rights impact assessments, improvements in working conditions, and the implementation of systems to prevent discrimination\nand harassment help mitigate the risk of legal disputes, consumer boycotts, and reputational damage—thereby reducing potential social costs\nbefore they arise. Proactive prevention of human rights risks enhances long-term corporate credibility and fosters positive ripple effects, such as\nActual/Potential\nreduced social conflict and operational cost savings.\nImpacts\nOn the other hand, failures to address human rights issues can significantly damage a company’s reputation and erode public trust, potentially\nresulting in legal action or regulatory sanctions. If such violations lead to investor withdrawal or divestment, the resulting social losses can escalate\nrapidly.

Impact Analysis and Response Measures\n· SK Inc. identifies key climate-related risks and opportunities and presents corresponding response strategies across the following three areas\n· 1) Net Zero implementation, 2) Response strategies for business sites and supply chain, 3) Transition opportunities related to climate change\n1) Net Zero Implementation\nT1 Policy Volatility in RE100 Implementation in South Korea\nImpact Analysis\n· South Korea’s renewable energy supply policies and pricing mechanisms present structural risks for companies pursuing RE100, particularly in terms of limited\nprocurement options and price volatility\n· In practice, the availability and efficiency of renewable energy procurement methods—such as self-generation, green premiums, and PPAs—are heavily influenced by\ngovernment policies, leading to significant variability and potential uncertainty in establishing long-term strategies for achieving RE100\nRE100 Implementation Options in South Korea Limitation\nGreen Premium Lack of recognition as actual GHG reduction under the Emissions Trading Scheme\nREC Price risk due to volatility in the government’s RPS* operations\nPPA Scheme Constraints such as higher prices compared to conventional electricity and limited supply volume\n* RPS: Renewable Portfolio Standard; A regulatory system that mandates a specific percentage of total electricity generation to be supplied or procured from renewable\nenergy sources\nResponse Measures\n· In line with the self-generation-first strategy, solar power facilities with a total capacity of 650kW are in operation by maximizing the use of available space within business\nsites. This is expected to reduce annual electricity costs by approximately KRW 100 million and cut more than 400 tons of greenhouse gas emissions\n· In addition to self-generation, a strategic combination of multiple renewable energy procurement methods—such as green premiums, power purchase agreements (PPAs),\nand renewable energy certificates (RECs)—is under active review\n· Since 2021, SK Inc. has participated in RE100 policy discussions hosted by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. In 2022, it joined the Corporate Renewable Energy\nFoundation (CREF) as a member and sponsor, contributing as a private-sector participant to government policy improvement efforts\nEstimated Additional Electricity Purchase Costs for Implementing the RE100 2040 Roadmap (2021–2040)\nGeneral Electricity Cost Green Premium Only Mixed*\nKRW 1,166.7 billion + KRW 56.6 billion +KRW 17.0 billion\n* Mixed: Electricity cost + Green Premium fee + PPA + Emissions Allowance\n※ Key assumptions for cost estimation: Assumes an average annual electricity rate increase of 3% through 2040 and reflects profit and loss from emissions\nallowances based on a carbon credit price of KRW 15,000\nT3 Strengthening of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)\nImpact Analysis\n· In 2022, SK Inc. was designated as a covered entity subject to paid allocation under the national Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and changes in ETS policy and carbon\nprice fluctuations are now recognized as material financial risks at the company-wide level\n· As of 2024, 18 business sites are subject to both free and paid allocations under the scheme. While the paid allocation ratio stood at 10% during the 3rd commitment\nperiod, it is expected to rise in the 4th commitment period\n· The increasing share of paid allocations is projected to drive up domestic carbon prices, resulting in higher carbon allowance purchase costs for SK Inc\nResponse Measures\n· A company-wide response framework has been established to manage the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), enabling flexible responses to evolving conditions through\ncontinuous monitoring of GHG emissions, policy shifts, and carbon market fluctuations\n· Aligned with the Net Zero 2040 roadmap, SK Inc. is progressively implementing GHG reduction initiatives such as the deployment of self-generation systems, procurement\nof renewable energy through RECs and PPAs, and enhanced energy efficiency at data centers\n· In preparation for an increase in the proportion of paid allocations and rising carbon prices, the company is reinforcing its emissions management system and executing\ncomplementary strategies to mitigate the financial impact of allowance purchases\n· As a fundamental approach to decarbonization, SK Inc. is continuously evaluating and expanding the adoption of carbon reduction and energy-efficient technologies,\nincluding high-efficiency HVAC systems\nSK Inc.

Site & Supply Chain Response Strategy\nP1 Impact of Rising Temperatures on Data Center Operating Costs\nImpact Analysis\n· Electricity consumption from cooling systems and IT equipment accounts for approximately 45% of total data center operating costs, and rising ambient temperatures are\na key physical risk factor that directly leads to increased electricity expenses\n· The growing frequency of heatwaves and tropical nights during summer elevates cooling system usage, resulting in higher energy consumption and potentially driving up\ncumulative annual operating costs\n· A sustained 1°C increase in average external temperature could raise annual electricity costs by approximately 2.5–3.5%, resulting in an estimated additional expenditure\nof KRW 440 to 620 million per year\nResponse Measures\n· To mitigate physical risks associated with rising temperatures, high-efficiency HVAC systems are being introduced and energy-saving operational strategies are being\nimplemented in phases\n- To enhance cooling efficiency, an automatic misting system has been installed around the chiller units to supplement the performance of outdoor air cooling\n- Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions are utilized to precisely analyze airflow and optimize the performance of the HVAC system\n- Data center-specific energy efficiency strategies are being continuously reinforced, including the replacement of inefficient HVAC equipment, relocation of IT devices,\nand advanced temperature control by zone\nP1 Disaster Recovery Costs from Large-Scale River Flooding at Data Centers\nImpact Analysis\n· Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (a global warming pathway exceeding 4°C), the likelihood of damage to data center assets from large-scale river flooding—currently\nconsidered 100-year occurrences—is projected to increase significantly after 2030\n· In the event of flooding, facility restoration costs and business interruption losses could amount to more than 30% of the total asset value of the data center\n· Power outages and service disruptions may result in compensation claims due to customer SLA violations, along with additional recovery costs\nResponse Measures\n· Disaster response infrastructure is being established to withstand heavy rainfall exceeding 100mm per hour, with flood response drills and humidity control simulation\ntraining conducted at least once a year on a regular basis\n- During weather advisories, preemptive inspections and reinforcements of key infrastructure—such as leakage points, drainage pumps, and channels—are conducted\nto prevent potential damage\n- To prepare for large-scale power outages, a dual power system with high-capacity UPS units and emergency generators is maintained, along with regular power\nswitchover drills to ensure immediate and uninterrupted transition to backup power during grid failure\n- These measures are intended to ensure the availability of data centers and the continuity of customer SLAs in the event of a disaster\nP2 Disruption of Supplier Manufacturing Facilities Due to Natural Disasters\nImpact Analysis\n· Approximately 60% of the hardware (H/W) and network (N/W) equipment required for IT service delivery is sourced from overseas manufacturing facilities located in\ncountries such as China, Malaysia, Ireland, and Singapore (as of 2022)\n· According to scenario analyses under SSP5 to SSP8.5, these regions are identified as having relatively high risks of water stress and other climate-related disasters,\nincluding floods and heatwaves, indicating vulnerabilities in the supply chain\n· In the event of natural disasters that disrupt raw material procurement or suspend the production of specific equipment, indirect impacts may include delivery delays,\nincreased procurement costs, higher prices of competing products, disruptions to customer project timelines, and revenue losses\nResponse Measures\n· To address physical risks at the supply chain level, business continuity planning (BCP) status is reviewed for key suppliers, and suppliers are requested to establish climate\nrisk response plans\n· To prevent overconcentration of manufacturing bases in high-risk areas, the results of regular risk monitoring are incorporated into supply diversification strategies\n· Physical climate risk levels at supplier locations are pre-assessed using Climanomics®-based risk modeling and are integrated into the supply chain management process\nat least once a year\n3) Climate Transition Opportunities\nO4 Growing Demand for IT Solutions/Services for Climate Change Response\nImpact Analysis\n· South Korea has introduced mid- to long-term national strategies through its ‘2050 Carbon Neutrality Scenario,’ including energy management systems (EMS), building\nenergy efficiency improvements, and expansion of electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure—serving as a foundation for increased demand for related IT solutions\n· Demand is expected to rise, particularly in the manufacturing sector and energy-intensive industries, for advanced EMS, EV charging station management platforms, and\nIT services linked to emissions monitoring\n· According to the latest IEA Net Zero scenario, achieving the 1.5°C target is unlikely under the current Net Zero 2050 strategies alone, indicating the need for stronger\nregulations and carbon reduction efforts driven by digital technologies\n· As Scope 3 reduction requirements (including supply chain emissions) continue to expand, managing carbon footprints based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and\nparticipating in carbon credit markets are emerging as key non-financial strategic priorities among global companies\nResponse Measures\n· As the importance of value chain management grows and transparency in emissions reductions becomes increasingly demanded, the need for digital management\nsystems to support GHG measurement and verification, emissions tracking, and carbon credit transactions is expected to rise\n· Leveraging its digital capabilities in big data, AI, and blockchain, SK Inc. views this rising climate response demand as a business opportunity driven by digital transformation\n· In particular, SK Inc. is developing and providing end-to-end climate response services—from carbon emissions monitoring and reduction simulation to carbon credit-\nlinked transactions—from the perspective of serving as a ‘Green Digital Partner’ to support customers in their Net Zero transition\nSK Inc.
