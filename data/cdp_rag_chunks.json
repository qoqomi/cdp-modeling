If you undertake strategic and/or financial planning under a different timeframe, explain why \nthe time horizon chosen for the identification, assessment, and management of environmental \nissues is different to that used in these other processes. \n  \nAdditional \ninformation  \n TCFD and TNFD position on time horizons: Because the timing of effects on organizations will vary, specifying set timeframes across \nsectors could hinder organizations’ consideration of the environmental risks and opportunities \nspecific to their businesses. TCFD and TNFD do not define timeframes and encourage respondents to decide how to define \ntheir own timeframes considering the useful life of their assets or infrastructure, the profile of \nthe environmental risks they face, the sectors and geographies in which they operate, and that \nenvironmental risks and opportunities can manifest themselves over the medium and long \nterm. Page 2 In assessing environmental issues, organizations should be sensitive to the timeframe used to \nconduct their assessments. While many organizations conduct operational and financial \nplanning over a 1–2 year timeframe, and strategic and capital planning over a 2 year \ntimeframe, environmental risks and opportunities may have implications over a longer period. It \nis therefore important for organizations to consider the appropriate timeframes when \nassessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities.",

    "content": "Question ID: 2.2.2\nTitle: Provide details of your organization’s process for identifying, assessing, and managing environmental\n\nRationale: Organizations that have established a comprehensive, recurring procedure to identify, assess, \nand manage environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across their value \nchain and over a range of time-horizons will be better equipped to handle longer-term \nuncertainties and liabilities, as well as capitalize on opportunities. This question indicates to data \nusers how robust an organization’s assessment process is.\n\nAmbition: The organization has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across its direct operations, value chain, \nfinanced activities, and assets. The organization maps its value chain, screens sites, and engages stakeholders to identify \nand assess environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is integrated \ninto a multi disciplinary organization wide risk management, covers transition and physical \nrisks/opportunities over different timeframes, and discloses methods and significance \ncriteria. The organization conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a year \nand describes how data was obtained. The organization describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk and \nopportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the organization’s \nactivities and relevant timeframes.\n\nRequested Content: Organizations are requested to report information on their approach to evaluating their \ndependencies and/or impacts on the environment, and consequently their approach to \nassessing risks and/or opportunities that are identified through understanding their \ndependencies and/or impacts \no \nThis question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety. \no \nIf your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all \nthat apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”. \no \nIf your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate \nthese differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how \nenvironmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text \nfields to provide details of these differences.      \no \nIf you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if the \nprocess differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows \naccordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor \ndifferences between the processes. \nCoverage (column 4) This column will be presented if “Direct operations”, “Upstream value chain” or “Downstream \nvalue chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain stages covered”. If certain elements of your direct operations, or other parts of your value chain are excluded \nfrom the assessment process, select \"Partial\" and explain your reasons in column 16 “Further \ndetails of process”. \n \nSupplier tiers covered (column 5) This column will be presented if “Upstream value chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain \nstages covered”. The options in this column are dependent on the estimate of highest supplier tier mapped or \nknown that is provided in 1.24. Select all options that represent the supplier tiers covered in your assessment process. \n \nType of assessment (column 7) Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both. Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings, \ninterviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices. Page 11 Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables, \nand metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and \nseverity of events. \n \nFrequency of assessment (column 8) Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or \nopportunities are assessed and/or reviewed. \no \nThe frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you \ncomplete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. \nFor example, long term risks may be relevant for several years and only require \nperiodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the \nfrequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed \nand/or reviewed. \nTime horizons covered (column 9) Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you only \nconsider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the environmental issue \nselected in column 1 “Environmental issue” in the short term (in line with your definition of time \nhorizons provided in 2.1), you should select “short term” here. Or, if you consider dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and/or opportunities over short term, medium term, and long term time \nhorizons, select all three. \n \nIntegration of risk management process (column 10) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”. Select the option that best describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and \nmanaging risks is integrated into your overall assessment framework. \no \nIntegrated into multi disciplinary organization wide risk management process: a \ndocumented process where risks are identified and assessed in an integrated way \nin the company’s centralized enterprise risk management program covering all \npossible types/sources of risks. \no \nA specific environmental risk management process: a documented process that \nidentifies, assesses, and manages risks separately from other business risks. \n \nLocation specificity used (column 11) Site specific: the assessment process is conducted within the sites that your organization \nand/or its suppliers operate in, or any other relevant operational sites. Local: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below sub national level \n(e.g., cities, towns, villages). Sub national: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below country/area level. This may include the immediate landscape that operational sites sit within and could \nimpact, or defined political boundaries (e.g., state, province, district, municipality). National: the assessment process is conducted across entire countries/areas. It does not \nconsider dependencies, impact, risks, and/or opportunities that are specific to local areas or \nsites. \n \nRisk types and criteria considered (columns 13) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”. Select all options that best represent the types of risk considered in the assessment process, \nwhether a risk is subsequently identified or not: Page 12 79 \no \nAcute physical– occurrence of short term, specific events that change the state of \nthe environment. For example, cyclones, oil spills, forest fires or pests affecting a \nharvest; \no \nChronic physical – gradual changes to the state of the environment. For example, \npollution stemming from pesticide use or sea level rise driven by climate change. \no \nPolicy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing) \npolicies to create positive impacts on the environment or mitigate negative impacts \non the environment; \no \nTechnology – substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on the \nenvironment and/or reduced dependency on the environment. For example, the \nreplacement of plastics with biodegradable containers; \no \nMarket – changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer \npreferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and \nreputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value \nof a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is \ninsufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’ \nproduction process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require \nless water to operate; \no \nReputation – changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or \nperceived environmental impacts, including at the local, economic and societal \nlevel. This can result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or \nimpacts of activities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain; \no \nLiability – liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims. As laws, \nregulations and case law related to an organization’s preparedness for nature \naction evolves, the incident or probability of contingent liabilities arising from an \norganization may increase. \n \nFurther details of process (column 16) Describe your process for identifying, assessing, and managing dependencies, impacts, risks, \nand/or opportunities, including: \no \nIf relevant to your selections in 2.2, an assessment of how your organization’s \ndependencies and/or impacts inform your assessment of your organization’s risks \nand/or opportunities. \no \nThe proportion of operational locations assessed (screening site locations, business \nactivities and assets within value chain to identify dependencies, impacts, risks, \nand/or opportunities). \no \nThe methodology/data sources used for key data not obtained directly from the \norganization's operations. \no \nDescribes how your process for identifying, assessing, and managing dependencies, \nimpacts, and/or opportunities is integrated into your company wide risk \nmanagement process. Describe the process used to determine which risks and/or opportunities could have a \nsubstantive financial or strategic effect on the organization, and which dependencies and/or \nimpacts are relevant to this, including: \no \nThe methodology used to assess the nature, likelihood, and magnitude of the effects \nof dependencies, impacts, risks, and/or opportunities (including qualitative factors, \nquantitative thresholds, or other criteria); \no \nThe inputs and parameters used (for example, information about data sources and \nthe scope of operations covered by the process); \no \nDetails on the use of scenario analysis; \no \nThe processes and related policies for monitoring dependencies, impacts, risks, \nand/or opportunities. Page 13 If in column 3 “Value chain stages covered” you did not indicate that all areas of your \norganization’s value chain are covered, explain why this is the case. If \"Partial\" was selected in column 4 “Coverage”, explain your exclusions and the reasons for \nthem. Indicate if this process has changed since the last reporting year. If it has changed, indicate if \ndata quality has been improved as a result. \n \nRequested \ncontent – [theme]  \n(if applicable) \nNote for Forests and Water disclosers: If you indicated in your questionnaire setup that you assess forests and/or water related \nissues, you should report on the details of the assessment processes here. E.g., if you \nindicated that you assess water related issues in questionnaire setup, you should report at \nleast 1 row with ‘Water’ selected in column 1 ‘Environmental issue’. \n \nRequested \ncontent – [sector]  \n(if applicable) \nNote for Financial Services companies This question is asking about the processes used to identify, assess, and respond to \nenvironmental dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities within your direct operations \nand upstream value chain. Please do not report the identification, assessment and \nmanagement of environmental dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities in your \nportfolio here. You will be able to do this in 2.2.6. \n \nExplanation of \nterms Direct operations: all activities and sites (e.g., buildings, farms, mines, retail stores) over \nwhich the reporting company has operational or financial control.  This covers any \ninternal supply chains between the organization’s business units (adapted from TNFD, \n2023; SBTN, 2023). Embedded commodity: a commodity is considered ‘embedded’ when it is used anywhere in \nthe supply chains, or the direct operations associated with a final product. Adapted from the \nSBTN embedded (or highly transformed commodities) are volumes of high impact \ncommodities, integrated into complex products, for example, companies do not purchase a \ncommodity in its raw or processed forms, but they purchase a product that contains them. \n(SBTN, 2023) Enterprise risk management: an integrated and joined up approach to managing risk \nacross an organization and its extended networks (Institute of Risk Management, 2016). Environmental risks: potential threats (effects of uncertainty) posed to an organization that arise \nfrom its and wider society’s dependencies and impacts on the environment. (Adapted from TNFD \n“Nature related risk”, 2023) Environmental opportunities: opportunities are generated through impacts and dependencies on \nnature, and can occur:  \no \nWhen organizations avoid, reduce, mitigate or manage nature related risks, for example, \nconnected to the loss of nature and ecosystem services that the organization and society \ndepend on;  \no \nThrough the strategic transformation of business models, products, services, markets and \ninvestments that actively work to reverse the loss of nature, including by restoration, \nregeneration of nature and implementation of nature based solutions (Adapted from TNFD \n“Nature related opportunities”, 2023). Leakage Market: refers to a market in which capital, income or commodities are diverted \nto non compliant activities. For example, Southeast Asian palm oil producers facing a \nrestrictive NDPE market, may move towards biofuel production due to weaker \nsustainability restrictions, creating potential for environmental damage and reputation \nrisk (CRR, 2020). Regulator: a body with a statutory authority to enforce laws, standards, and other legal \nregulations. They are appointed by government but can operate independently of it. Page 14 Risk management: involved understanding, identifying, assessing, and responding to \nrisk to make sure organizations achieve their objectives. This must be proportionate to \nthe complexity and type of organization (based on Institute of Risk Management, 2016). \nRisk management is a set of processes which are conducted by the board and \nmanagement of an organization to support achievement of objectives through \naddressing risks and management of the combined potential impacts identified \n(Adapted from TCFD, 2021). Upstream and downstream risks: defined based on the location of the risks in your value \nchain and can also refer to any of the risk types above i.e. emerging regulation, \ntechnology, legal, market reputation etc. Value chain: the entire sequence of upstream and downstream activities, sites, \nresources, and relationships associated with the reporting organization’s operations, \nstarting with the raw materials, and extending through end life management, aimed \nat providing or receiving value from an organization’s products and services either \nwithin, upstream, or downstream of direct operations (adapted from GHG Protocol, \n2013; ESRS, 2023; SBTN, 2023). Value chain stage: A part of the sequence of activities that provide value to/ or receive value \nfrom the organization’s products and services. This can include activities within the \norganizations direct operations, or up or downstream of those operations; such as the supply \nchain, joint ventures, franchisees and product users. Water stress (‘areas with’): a concept that considers physical quantity aspects related to water \nresources, including water availability. As good practice, a water stressed area should be \nmeasured at the catchment level as a minimum. Commonly accepted global indicators to assess \nareas as water stressed and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include: \no \nWater availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter). WWF \nrecommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’: >2.6. This category is \nbased on a multi model approach which integrates the best available global water scarcity \nrisk indicators: water depletion, baseline water stress, and blue water scarcity. \no \nBaseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40 80% (WRI Aqueduct Water \nRisk Atlas). This refers to ratio of total annual water withdrawals to available renewable water \nsupply. \no \nBaseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50 75% (WRI Aqueduct \nWater Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water consumption to available \nrenewable water supply. \n \nAdditional \ninformation For information on dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities, and how they relate to each \nother – see TNFD’s “Guidance on the identification and assessment of nature related issues: the \nLEAP approach”, 2023.",

    "content": "Question ID: 2.2.6\nTitle: Provide details of your organization’s process for identifying, assessing, and managing environmental\n\nRationale: Financial institutions that have established a comprehensive, recurring procedure to identify, \nassess, and manage environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all \ntheir portfolios and over a range of time-horizons will be better equipped to handle longer-term \nuncertainties and liabilities, as well as capitalize on opportunities. This question indicates to data \nusers how robust a financial institution’s assessment process is.\n\nAmbition: The financial institution has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all of its portfolios. The financial institution maps its portfolios and engages stakeholders to identify and assess \nenvironmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is integrated into a multi disciplinary \nportfolio wide \nrisk \nmanagement, \ncovers \ntransition \nand \nphysical \nrisks/opportunities over different timeframes, and discloses methods and significance criteria. Financial institutions include the value of their total assets and the proportion to which the \nidentification, assessment and management process and environmental strategy apply. The financial institution conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a \nyear, describing how data was obtained, and evaluates the linkages between assessing \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. The financial institution describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk \nand opportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the \norganization’s activities and relevant timeframes.\n\nRequested Content: For each portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio”, financial institutions are requested to report \ninformation on their approach to evaluating their dependencies and/or impacts on the \nenvironment, and consequently their approach to assessing risks and/or opportunities in \ntheir lending, financial intermediary, investment and/or insurance underwriting activities, \nthat are identified through understanding its their dependencies and/or impacts. \no \nThis question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety. \no \nIf your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all \nthat apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”. \no \nIf your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate \nthese differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how Page 26 93 \nenvironmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text \nfields to provide details of these differences.  \no \nIf you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if the \nprocess differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows \naccordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor \ndifferences between the processes. \n \nPortfolio (column 0) The rows presented in this table depend on your response to 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 Respond to all rows individually. \n \n% of portfolio covered by the assessment process in relation to total portfolio value (column 3) For each of your portfolios, disclose the percentage of portfolio value covered by the \nassessment process to the portfolio value based on assets value reported in 1.10. \n \nType of assessment (column 4) Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both. Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings, \ninterviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices. Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables \nand metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and \nseverity of events. \n \nFrequency of assessment (column 6) Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or \nopportunities are assessed and/or reviewed. \no \nThe frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you \ncomplete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. \nFor example, long term risks may be relevant for several years and only require \nperiodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the \nfrequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed \nand/or reviewed. \nTime horizons covered (column 7) Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you \nonly consider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the portfolio in \ncolumn 0 “Portfolio” in the short term (in line with your definition of time horizons provided \nin 2.1), you should select “short term” here. Or, if you consider, short term, medium term \nand long term time horizons, select all three. \n \nIntegration of risk management process (column 8) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”.

Water consumption: the amount of water that is drawn into the boundaries of an organization \nand not discharged back to the water environment or a third party over the course of a \nreporting year. Water stress (‘areas with’): a concept that considers physical quantity aspects related to water \nresources, including water availability. As good practice, a water stressed area should be Page 40 107 \nmeasured at the catchment level as a minimum. Commonly accepted global indicators to assess \nareas as water stressed and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include: \no \nWater availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter). WWF \nrecommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’: >2.6. This category \nis based on a multi model approach which integrates the best available global water \nscarcity risk indicators: water depletion, baseline water stress, and blue water scarcity. \no \nBaseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40 80% (WRI Aqueduct \nWater Risk Atlas). This refers to ratio of total annual water withdrawals to available \nrenewable water supply. \no \nBaseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50 75% (WRI \nAqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water consumption \nto available renewable water supply.

    "type": "question",
    "content": "Question ID: 2.2.2\nTitle: Provide details of your organization’s process for identifying, assessing, and managing environmental\n\nRationale: Organizations that have established a comprehensive, recurring procedure to identify, assess, \nand manage environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across their value \nchain and over a range of time-horizons will be better equipped to handle longer-term \nuncertainties and liabilities, as well as capitalize on opportunities. This question indicates to data \nusers how robust an organization’s assessment process is.\n\nAmbition: The organization has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across its direct operations, value chain, \nfinanced activities, and assets. The organization maps its value chain, screens sites, and engages stakeholders to identify \nand assess environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is integrated \ninto a multi disciplinary organization wide risk management, covers transition and physical \nrisks/opportunities over different timeframes, and discloses methods and significance \ncriteria. The organization conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a year \nand describes how data was obtained. The organization describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk and \nopportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the organization’s \nactivities and relevant timeframes.\n\nRequested Content: Organizations are requested to report information on their approach to evaluating their \ndependencies and/or impacts on the environment, and consequently their approach to \nassessing risks and/or opportunities that are identified through understanding their \ndependencies and/or impacts \no \nThis question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety. \no \nIf your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all \nthat apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”. \no \nIf your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate \nthese differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how \nenvironmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text \nfields to provide details of these differences.      \no \nIf you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if the \nprocess differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows \naccordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor \ndifferences between the processes. \nCoverage (column 4) This column will be presented if “Direct operations”, “Upstream value chain” or “Downstream \nvalue chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain stages covered”. If certain elements of your direct operations, or other parts of your value chain are excluded \nfrom the assessment process, select \"Partial\" and explain your reasons in column 16 “Further \ndetails of process”. \n \nSupplier tiers covered (column 5) This column will be presented if “Upstream value chain” is selected in column 3 “Value chain \nstages covered”. The options in this column are dependent on the estimate of highest supplier tier mapped or \nknown that is provided in 1.24. Select all options that represent the supplier tiers covered in your assessment process. \n \nType of assessment (column 7) Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both. Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings, \ninterviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices. Page 11 Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables, \nand metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and \nseverity of events. \n \nFrequency of assessment (column 8) Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or \nopportunities are assessed and/or reviewed. \no \nThe frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you \ncomplete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. \nFor example, long term risks may be relevant for several years and only require \nperiodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the \nfrequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed \nand/or reviewed. \nTime horizons covered (column 9) Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you only \nconsider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the environmental issue \nselected in column 1 “Environmental issue” in the short term (in line with your definition of time \nhorizons provided in 2.1), you should select “short term” here. Or, if you consider dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and/or opportunities over short term, medium term, and long term time \nhorizons, select all three. \n \nIntegration of risk management process (column 10) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”. Select the option that best describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and \nmanaging risks is integrated into your overall assessment framework. \no \nIntegrated into multi disciplinary organization wide risk management process: a \ndocumented process where risks are identified and assessed in an integrated way \nin the company’s centralized enterprise risk management program covering all \npossible types/sources of risks. \no \nA specific environmental risk management process: a documented process that \nidentifies, assesses, and manages risks separately from other business risks. \n \nLocation specificity used (column 11) Site specific: the assessment process is conducted within the sites that your organization \nand/or its suppliers operate in, or any other relevant operational sites. Local: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below sub national level \n(e.g., cities, towns, villages). Sub national: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below country/area level. This may include the immediate landscape that operational sites sit within and could \nimpact, or defined political boundaries (e.g., state, province, district, municipality). National: the assessment process is conducted across entire countries/areas. It does not \nconsider dependencies, impact, risks, and/or opportunities that are specific to local areas or \nsites. \n \nRisk types and criteria considered (columns 13) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”. Select all options that best represent the types of risk considered in the assessment process, \nwhether a risk is subsequently identified or not: Page 12 79 \no \nAcute physical– occurrence of short term, specific events that change the state of \nthe environment. For example, cyclones, oil spills, forest fires or pests affecting a \nharvest; \no \nChronic physical – gradual changes to the state of the environment. For example, \npollution stemming from pesticide use or sea level rise driven by climate change. \no \nPolicy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing) \npolicies to create positive impacts on the environment or mitigate negative impacts \non the environment; \no \nTechnology – substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on the \nenvironment and/or reduced dependency on the environment. For example, the \nreplacement of plastics with biodegradable containers; \no \nMarket – changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer \npreferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and \nreputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value \nof a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is \ninsufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’ \nproduction process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require \nless water to operate; \no \nReputation – changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or \nperceived environmental impacts, including at the local, economic and societal \nlevel. This can result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or \nimpacts of activities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain; \no \nLiability – liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims.

If \"Partial\" was selected in column 4 “Coverage”, explain your exclusions and the reasons for \nthem. Indicate if this process has changed since the last reporting year. If it has changed, indicate if \ndata quality has been improved as a result. \n \nRequested \ncontent – [theme]  \n(if applicable) \nNote for Forests and Water disclosers: If you indicated in your questionnaire setup that you assess forests and/or water related \nissues, you should report on the details of the assessment processes here. E.g., if you \nindicated that you assess water related issues in questionnaire setup, you should report at \nleast 1 row with ‘Water’ selected in column 1 ‘Environmental issue’. \n \nRequested \ncontent – [sector]  \n(if applicable) \nNote for Financial Services companies This question is asking about the processes used to identify, assess, and respond to \nenvironmental dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities within your direct operations \nand upstream value chain. Please do not report the identification, assessment and \nmanagement of environmental dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities in your \nportfolio here. You will be able to do this in 2.2.6. \n \nExplanation of \nterms Direct operations: all activities and sites (e.g., buildings, farms, mines, retail stores) over \nwhich the reporting company has operational or financial control.  This covers any \ninternal supply chains between the organization’s business units (adapted from TNFD, \n2023; SBTN, 2023). Embedded commodity: a commodity is considered ‘embedded’ when it is used anywhere in \nthe supply chains, or the direct operations associated with a final product. Adapted from the \nSBTN embedded (or highly transformed commodities) are volumes of high impact \ncommodities, integrated into complex products, for example, companies do not purchase a \ncommodity in its raw or processed forms, but they purchase a product that contains them. \n(SBTN, 2023) Enterprise risk management: an integrated and joined up approach to managing risk \nacross an organization and its extended networks (Institute of Risk Management, 2016). Environmental risks: potential threats (effects of uncertainty) posed to an organization that arise \nfrom its and wider society’s dependencies and impacts on the environment. (Adapted from TNFD \n“Nature related risk”, 2023) Environmental opportunities: opportunities are generated through impacts and dependencies on \nnature, and can occur:  \no \nWhen organizations avoid, reduce, mitigate or manage nature related risks, for example, \nconnected to the loss of nature and ecosystem services that the organization and society \ndepend on;  \no \nThrough the strategic transformation of business models, products, services, markets and \ninvestments that actively work to reverse the loss of nature, including by restoration, \nregeneration of nature and implementation of nature based solutions (Adapted from TNFD \n“Nature related opportunities”, 2023). Leakage Market: refers to a market in which capital, income or commodities are diverted \nto non compliant activities. For example, Southeast Asian palm oil producers facing a \nrestrictive NDPE market, may move towards biofuel production due to weaker \nsustainability restrictions, creating potential for environmental damage and reputation \nrisk (CRR, 2020). Regulator: a body with a statutory authority to enforce laws, standards, and other legal \nregulations. They are appointed by government but can operate independently of it. Page 14 Risk management: involved understanding, identifying, assessing, and responding to \nrisk to make sure organizations achieve their objectives. This must be proportionate to \nthe complexity and type of organization (based on Institute of Risk Management, 2016). \nRisk management is a set of processes which are conducted by the board and \nmanagement of an organization to support achievement of objectives through \naddressing risks and management of the combined potential impacts identified \n(Adapted from TCFD, 2021). Upstream and downstream risks: defined based on the location of the risks in your value \nchain and can also refer to any of the risk types above i.e. emerging regulation, \ntechnology, legal, market reputation etc. Value chain: the entire sequence of upstream and downstream activities, sites, \nresources, and relationships associated with the reporting organization’s operations, \nstarting with the raw materials, and extending through end life management, aimed \nat providing or receiving value from an organization’s products and services either \nwithin, upstream, or downstream of direct operations (adapted from GHG Protocol, \n2013; ESRS, 2023; SBTN, 2023). Value chain stage: A part of the sequence of activities that provide value to/ or receive value \nfrom the organization’s products and services. This can include activities within the \norganizations direct operations, or up or downstream of those operations; such as the supply \nchain, joint ventures, franchisees and product users. Water stress (‘areas with’): a concept that considers physical quantity aspects related to water \nresources, including water availability. As good practice, a water stressed area should be \nmeasured at the catchment level as a minimum. Commonly accepted global indicators to assess \nareas as water stressed and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include: \no \nWater availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter). WWF \nrecommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’: >2.6. This category is \nbased on a multi model approach which integrates the best available global water scarcity \nrisk indicators: water depletion, baseline water stress, and blue water scarcity. \no \nBaseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40 80% (WRI Aqueduct Water \nRisk Atlas). This refers to ratio of total annual water withdrawals to available renewable water \nsupply. \no \nBaseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50 75% (WRI Aqueduct \nWater Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water consumption to available \nrenewable water supply. \n \nAdditional \ninformation For information on dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities, and how they relate to each \nother – see TNFD’s “Guidance on the identification and assessment of nature related issues: the \nLEAP approach”, 2023.",

    "content": "Question ID: 2.2.6\nTitle: Provide details of your organization’s process for identifying, assessing, and managing environmental\n\nRationale: Financial institutions that have established a comprehensive, recurring procedure to identify, \nassess, and manage environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all \ntheir portfolios and over a range of time-horizons will be better equipped to handle longer-term \nuncertainties and liabilities, as well as capitalize on opportunities. This question indicates to data \nusers how robust a financial institution’s assessment process is.\n\nAmbition: The financial institution has a robust process to identify, assess, and manage environmental \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across all of its portfolios. The financial institution maps its portfolios and engages stakeholders to identify and assess \nenvironmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. This is integrated into a multi disciplinary \nportfolio wide \nrisk \nmanagement, \ncovers \ntransition \nand \nphysical \nrisks/opportunities over different timeframes, and discloses methods and significance criteria. Financial institutions include the value of their total assets and the proportion to which the \nidentification, assessment and management process and environmental strategy apply. The financial institution conducts the identification and assessment process at least once a \nyear, describing how data was obtained, and evaluates the linkages between assessing \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities. The financial institution describes how the outputs from the scenario analysis are used in risk \nand opportunity identification, assessment, and management processes, given the \norganization’s activities and relevant timeframes.\n\nRequested Content: For each portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio”, financial institutions are requested to report \ninformation on their approach to evaluating their dependencies and/or impacts on the \nenvironment, and consequently their approach to assessing risks and/or opportunities in \ntheir lending, financial intermediary, investment and/or insurance underwriting activities, \nthat are identified through understanding its their dependencies and/or impacts. \no \nThis question seeks to capture a holistic overview of this process in its entirety. \no \nIf your process is the same for multiple environmental issues, you may select all \nthat apply in column 1 “Environmental issue”. \no \nIf your process differs for each environmental issue, add a new row and indicate \nthese differences accordingly. If there are minor differences between how Page 26 93 \nenvironmental issues are considered within your processes, you may use the text \nfields to provide details of these differences.  \no \nIf you have multiple processes for the same environmental issue, for example if the \nprocess differs for different stages of the value chain, you may add rows \naccordingly. Alternatively, you may use the text fields to provide details of minor \ndifferences between the processes. \n \nPortfolio (column 0) The rows presented in this table depend on your response to 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 Respond to all rows individually. \n \n% of portfolio covered by the assessment process in relation to total portfolio value (column 3) For each of your portfolios, disclose the percentage of portfolio value covered by the \nassessment process to the portfolio value based on assets value reported in 1.10. \n \nType of assessment (column 4) Disclose whether the assessment is qualitative, quantitative, or both. Qualitative assessment is descriptive and may include stakeholder involvement, meetings, \ninterviews, and analysis of scenario impacts or descriptive risk matrices. Quantitative assessment is expressed in numbers and involves indicators, indices, variables \nand metrics such as probabilistic or stochastic risk modelling considering frequency and \nseverity of events. \n \nFrequency of assessment (column 6) Select the option that best reflects the frequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or \nopportunities are assessed and/or reviewed. \no \nThe frequency disclosed here does not necessarily mean the frequency you \ncomplete a full assessment of all dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. \nFor example, long term risks may be relevant for several years and only require \nperiodic review. Therefore, you may select the option that best reflects the \nfrequency that all dependencies, impacts, risks and/or opportunities are assessed \nand/or reviewed. \nTime horizons covered (column 7) Choose all the time horizons that are considered in your assessment. For example, if you \nonly consider dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities relating to the portfolio in \ncolumn 0 “Portfolio” in the short term (in line with your definition of time horizons provided \nin 2.1), you should select “short term” here. Or, if you consider, short term, medium term \nand long term time horizons, select all three. \n \nIntegration of risk management process (column 8) This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 2 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process”. Select the option that best describes how your process for identifying, assessing, and \nmanaging risks related to the portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio” is integrated into your overall \nassessment framework. \no \nIntegrated into multi disciplinary organization wide risk management processes: a \ndocumented process where risks related to the portfolio in column 0 “Portfolio” are \nidentified and assessed in an integrated way in the company’s centralized enterprise \nrisk management program covering all possible types/sources of risks. Page 27 94 \no \nA specific environmental risk management process: a documented process that \nidentifies, assesses, and manages risks related to the portfolio in column 0 \n“Portfolio” separately from other business risks. \n \nLocation specificity used (column 9) Site specific: the assessment process is conducted within the sites that your organization \nand/or its suppliers operate in, or any other relevant operational sites. Local: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below sub national level \n(e.g., cities, towns, villages). Sub national: the assessment process is conducted within a defined area below \ncountry/area level. This may include the immediate landscape that operational sites sit \nwithin and could impact, or defined political boundaries (e.g., state, province, district, \nmunicipality). National: the assessment process is conducted across entire countries/areas. It does not \nconsider dependencies, impact, risks, and/or opportunities that are specific to local areas or \nsites. \n \nTools and methods used (column 10) Select which tools and methodologies you use to assess your portfolio’s exposure to \nenvironmental risks: \no \nUNEP FI Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for Banks: helps banks analyze the impacts \nassociated with their retail (consumer and business banking) and wholesale (corporate \nand investment banking) portfolios. \no \nUNEP FI Corporate Impact Analysis Tool: enables users to perform a holistic analysis \nof companies, based on the reality of those companies’ business activities and the \nneeds of the countries in which they operate, whether for sourcing, production, or \nsales. \no \n2DII Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) tool: portfolio level \nanalysis for equities and fixed income climate transition risks in power and some \nindustrial sectors (cement and steel). \no \nThe Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI): bottom up assessment of how listed \ncompanies are preparing for the transition to a low carbon economy. \no \n2 Degrees of Separation: In depth sector and company level analysis of oil and gas \ncompanies’ upstream exposure to climate transition risks. \no \nPortfolio temperature alignment: portfolio alignment tools are used to generate metrics \nto determine the overall level of alignment of a portfolio, by assessing the performance \nof its individual companies. \no \nRisk models: computerized systems, such as catastrophe models, used to assess and \nquantify the financial impact of a range of potential future disasters. \no \nScenario analysis: considers how an organization is impacted by changes to \npolicy/regulation, technology or market changes aimed at emissions reductions, \nenergy efficiency, subsidies/taxes or other constraints or incentives implemented to \nfacilitate a low carbon economy (for example, the ‘well below 2°C’ goal committed to by \nthe Paris Agreement). Assesses the impact of acute or chronic physical change related \nto climate change such extreme weather, rising sea levels, water shortage, etc. \no \nStress tests: process of evaluating a number of statistically defined possibilities to \ndetermine the most damaging combination of events, and the loss they would \nproduce. The likelihood of such an event is then assessed. \no \nCorporate Bonds Water Credit Risk Tool (Water Credit Risk Tool): enables users to \nintegrate financial risk exposure to water scarcity into standard financial models used Page 28 95 \nto assess the credit strengths of corporates across water intensive sectors including \npower utilities, beverages and mining. \no \nDrought Stress Testing Tool: allows financial institutions to see how incorporating \ndrought scenarios changes the perception of risk in their own loan portfolios, based on \nthe catastrophe modelling framework (UNEP). \no \nENCORE: identifies business risks arising from economic dependencies on natural \ncapital (NCFA, Global Canopy, UN). \no \nEnvironmental Justice Atlas: documents and catalogues social conflict around \nenvironmental issues. \no \nGlobal Forests Watch Pro: delivers critical decision making analysis at the property, \nsupply shed and portfolio levels. \no \nInvestor Water Toolkit: supports the evaluation of water risks in investment portfolios, \nand includes links to other resources, data bases, case studies and tools (Ceres). \no \nRisk models: computerized systems, such as catastrophe models, used to assess and \nquantify the financial impact of a range of potential future disasters. \no \nStress tests: process of evaluating a number of statistically defined possibilities to \ndetermine the most damaging combination of events, and the loss they would \nproduce.

Aqueduct is comprised of tools that help \ncompanies, governments, and civil society understand and respond to water risks – \nsuch as water stress, variability from season season, pollution, and water access. \nAqueduct maps and data are used directly by hundreds of companies and are cited in \nmany publications. \no \nWWF Water Risk Filter: free online tool designed to help companies and investors to \nexplore, assess and act on water risks hotspots and opportunities across their direct \noperations, value chain and investments. \no \nWWF Biodiversity Risk Filter: free online tool designed to help companies and investors \nto identify biodiversity risks hotspots and opportunities across their direct operations, \nvalue chain and investments. \no If you select “Other, please specify”, please describe the tools and methodologies you use to \nassess your portfolio’s exposure. \n \nRisk type and criteria considered (columns 11) Page 29 This column only appears if you select “Risks” in column 1 “Indicate which of dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities are covered by the process for this portfolio”. Select the option that best represents the types of risk considered in your assessment \nprocess, having the following in mind: \no \nAcute physical – occurrence of short term, specific events that change the state of \nnature. For example, oil spills, forest fires or pests affecting a harvest; \no \nChronic physical – gradual changes to the state of nature. For example, pollution \nstemming from pesticide use or climate change. \no \nPolicy – changes in the policy context due to new (or enforcement of existing) \npolicies to create positive impacts on nature or mitigate negative impacts on nature; \no \nTechnology – Substitution of products or services with a reduced impact on nature \nand/or reduced dependency on nature. For example, the replacement of plastics \nwith biodegradable containers; \no \nMarket – Changing dynamics in overall markets, including changes in consumer \npreferences, which arise from changing physical, regulatory, technological and \nreputational conditions and stakeholder dynamics. For example, the market value \nof a company is affected by assets that have decreased in value because there is \ninsufficient freshwater for the production process, or the value of the business’ \nproduction process is reduced by the emergence of new technologies that require \nless water to operate; \no \nReputation – Changes in perception concerning an organization’s actual or \nperceived nature impacts, including at the local, economic and societal level. This \ncan result from direct company impacts, industry impacts and/or impacts of \nactivities upstream and/or downstream in a value chain. \no \nLiability – Liability risks that arise directly or indirectly from legal claims.

Breaches to local water regulations refers to failures in observing water regulations, which aim \nto prevent overuse, contamination and other detrimental activities. Certification: the action or process of providing a product with an official document attesting to \na status or level of achievement against a certain standard. Commodity volumes: the total volumes of a commodity that are produced and/or sourced by \nthe portfolio company. Certification of commodities:  a certification process is carried out by an independent \norganization to ensure environmental and social criteria have been met. Commitment to eliminate deforestation and conversion of other natural ecosystems: a \ncompany committing to no deforestation and no conversion of natural ecosystems. Deforestation: loss of natural forest as a result of: i) conversion to agriculture or other non forest land use; ii) conversion to a tree plantation; or iii) severe and sustained degradation. \no \nSevere and sustained degradation (scenario iii in the definition) constitutes \ndeforestation even if the land is not subsequently used for non forest land use. \no \nLoss of natural forest that meets this definition is considered to be deforestation \nregardless of whether or not it is legal. \no \nDeforestation signifies ‘gross deforestation’ of natural forest where ‘gross’ is used in \nthe sense of “total; aggregate; without deduction for reforestation or other offset.” \n(adapted from AFi, 2024). Conversion: loss of a natural ecosystem as a result of its replacement with agriculture or \nanother land use, or due to a profound and sustained change in the natural ecosystem’s \nspecies composition, structure, or function. \no \nDeforestation is one form of conversion (conversion of natural forests). Page 39 106 \no \nConversion includes severe degradation or the introduction of management practices that \nresult in a profound and sustained change in the ecosystem’s species composition, \nstructure, or function. \no \nChange to natural ecosystems that meets this definition is considered to be conversion \nregardless of whether or not it is legal (AFi, 2024). Due diligence: research or investigation performed by the financial services company before \ntransacting with another party. Impingements on the human right to water in communities refers water withdrawals, \nconsumption or discharges which limit the water availability for local communities due to \nquantity or quality factors. conversion (synonym: conversion free): commodity production, sourcing, or financial \ninvestments that do not cause or contribute to the conversion of natural ecosystems (as \ndefined by the Accountability Framework). \no \nNo conversion refers to no gross conversion of natural ecosystems, which the \nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for \ncompanies and supply chains. \no \nThe terms “no conversion” and “conversion free” are used in favor of “zero conversion” \nbecause “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds with the need to \nsometimes accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site level in the interest \nof facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes. deforestation (synonym: deforestation free): commodity production, sourcing, or financial \ninvestments that do not cause or contribute to deforestation (as defined by the Accountability \nFramework). \no \nNo deforestation refers to no gross deforestation of natural forests, which the \nAccountability Framework specifies as the appropriate policy and goal on this topic for \ncompanies and supply chains. \no \nIn the context of the Accountability Framework, deforestation refers to the loss of \nnatural forest (see definition of deforestation). \no \nThe terms “no deforestation” and “deforestation free” are used in favor of “zero \ndeforestation” because “zero” can imply an absolutist approach that may be at odds \nwith the need sometimes to accommodate minimal levels of conversion at the site \nlevel in the interest of facilitating optimal conservation and production outcomes (see \ndefinition for minimal level [of deforestation or conversion]). Origin of commodities:  where the supply base of a given commodity is grown, harvested or \nreared. Proportion of commodity volumes in compliance with no deforestation and conversion:  how \nmuch of the total commodity volume produced or consumed by the portfolio company can be \nverified as in compliance with no deforestation and no conversion policies and commitments. Scope and content of forests policy:  a statement by a portfolio organization specifying the \ngoals or targets that it intends to meet or the actions it intends to take in regards to its \nmanagement of forest related issues. Scope and content of water policy refers to a statement of an organization’s water related \ncommitments, and the actions that will achieve them. Traceability:  the ability to follow a product or its components through stages of the value chain \n(e.g., production, processing, manufacturing, and distribution) (adapted from AFi, 2024). Water withdrawal: the sum of all water drawn into the boundaries of an organization from all \nsources for any use over the course of a reporting period. Water consumption: the amount of water that is drawn into the boundaries of an organization \nand not discharged back to the water environment or a third party over the course of a \nreporting year. Water stress (‘areas with’): a concept that considers physical quantity aspects related to water \nresources, including water availability. As good practice, a water stressed area should be Page 40 107 \nmeasured at the catchment level as a minimum. Commonly accepted global indicators to assess \nareas as water stressed and their thresholds for reporting to CDP include: \no \nWater availability – category greater than ‘High risk’: 3.4 (WWF Water Risk Filter). WWF \nrecommends that users also take into consideration ‘Medium risk’: >2.6. This category \nis based on a multi model approach which integrates the best available global water \nscarcity risk indicators: water depletion, baseline water stress, and blue water scarcity. \no \nBaseline water stress – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 40 80% (WRI Aqueduct \nWater Risk Atlas). This refers to ratio of total annual water withdrawals to available \nrenewable water supply. \no \nBaseline water depletion – indicator equal to/greater than ‘High’: 50 75% (WRI \nAqueduct Water Risk Atlas). This refers to the ratio of total annual water consumption \nto available renewable water supply. Water discharge treatment data informs on the quality of effluents and other water leaving the \nboundaries of an organization and released to surface water, groundwater, or third parties.",

Identifying and prioritizing locations in or near areas with \necological sensitivity, as well as areas where the organization has substantive dependencies, \nimpacts, risks, and opportunities related to nature allows the organization to focus on areas \nwhere action is needed most urgently, maximizing the potential for positive impacts.\n\nAmbition: The organization identifies where in its direct operations and value chain it has activities in: \no \nSensitive locations: Locations where the activities in its direct operations – and, \nwhere possible upstream and downstream value chain – interface with nature in: Page 41 108 \n§ \nAreas important for biodiversity; and/or  \n§ \nAreas of high ecosystem integrity; and/or  \n§ \nAreas of rapid decline in ecosystem integrity; and/or  \n§ \nAreas of limited water availability, flooding, and/or poor quality of water; \nand/or  \n§ \nAreas of importance for ecosystem service provision. and/or \no \nLocations with substantive dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities: \nlocations where an organization has identified substantive nature related \ndependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in its direct operations, and \nupstream and downstream value chain. The organization discloses a list or spatial map of their identified priority locations.\n\nRequested Content: “Priority locations” are locations where your organization’s activities across the value chain \nhave interfaces with nature, which your organization has prioritized for action due to \ncertain characteristics that increase their vulnerability. Locations could be prioritized either because they are in or near ecologically sensitive \nlocations, e.g. in areas that are important for biodiversity; and/or because the organization \nhas identified substantive nature related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in \nthese locations.  \n \nDescription of process to identify priority locations (column 4) Outline your organization’s process to identify priority locations in each value chain stage, \nwith reference to your wider assessment process as reported in 2.2.2 if applicable. For \nexample: \no \nstate the tools, data sources, and indicators and metrics used; \no \nbriefly describe your approach to determine whether the dependencies, impacts, \nrisks, and/or opportunities in a location are substantive; and  \no \nspecify the thresholds used to define an area as a type of sensitive location.

    "content": "Question ID: 2.4\nTitle: How does your organization define substantive effects on your organization?\n\nRationale: Indicators and thresholds employed to define which effects on the organization are considered \nsubstantive can differ among disclosers depending on their sector, value chain, or geography. \nTherefore, outlining clear definitions on how organizations determine potential effects as \nsubstantive provides critical context to data users. This question increases transparency and \nimproves clarity as to what the discloser deems to be a substantive effect on their organization.\n\nAmbition: With respect to the identification, assessment, and management of substantive \nenvironmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities, the organization: \no \nDescribes how the organization defines substantive effects.\n\nRequested Content: This question seeks to define and quantify how your organization defines a ‘substantive \neffect’ on your organization at the corporate level, in the context of environmental risks \nand opportunities. This will be used to understand the threshold for your reported risks \nand opportunities in 3.1 and 3.6. What constitutes a substantive effect will vary between organizations. You are \ntherefore asked to determine ‘substantive’ in the way that you would do for your \nbusiness decision making. For example, a 1% reduction in profits will have different \neffects on different organizations depending on its respective profit margins. A \nsubstantive effect of relatively high magnitude could occur because of a large impact \non one of the following aspects, or because of a small number for all three combines to \ncreate a larger effect:  \no \nthe proportion of business units affected;  \no \nthe size of the effect on those business units;  \no \nthe dependency of the organization on that unit; and/or  \no \nthe potential for shareholder or customer concern. Use the “Add row” function if you define a substantive effect on your organization with \nrespect to risks or opportunities in more than one way. For example, if you use multiple \nindicators or have different definitions for different parts of the business.   \n \n% Change to indicator (column 5) This column only appears if “Quantitative” is selected in column 2 “Type of definition” and \neither “% increase” or “% decrease” is selected in column 4” Change to indicator”.  \n \nMetrics considered in definition (column 7) This column seeks to capture the different factors taken into account when defining a \nsubstantive effect on your organization with respect to risks and opportunities. If you have provided a quantitative definition, these metrics could give further context \nto your quantitative indicator. For example, you may define risks to be substantive if \nthey could lead to a 10% decrease in revenue over your short term time horizon (as Page 48 115 \ndefined in 2.1). In this case, select “Time horizon over which the effect occurs” and \nprovide further details in column 8 “Application of definition”. If you are only providing a qualitative definition, select all relevant metrics used to \ndefine a substantive effect, or use “Other, please specify” to specify a different metric.   \n  \nApplication of definition (column 8) Describe the thresholds considered to be substantive for the metrics reported in \ncolumn 7 “Metrics considered in definition”. For example:  \no \nFrequency of effect occurring: i.e. once, quarterly, every two years etc.  \no \nTime horizon over which the effect occurs: i.e., short , medium , and long term \nin line with your time horizons reported in 2.1.  \no \nLikelihood of effect occurring: i.e., the percentage chance the effect will occur Often, multiple metrics are used together as part of a matrix approach. If using a matrix \napproach, describe how the metrics selected in column 7 “Metrics considered in \ndefinition” are used in combination and their respective weightings. Describe how often the metrics, and their thresholds, are selected, reviewed, and \nupdated.  \n \nExplanation of \nterms Substantive effect: an effect that has a considerable or relatively significant effect on an \norganization at the corporate level in terms of risks and opportunities.
